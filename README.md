A simple GUI calculator built with Python's Tkinter provides an intuitive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed description:

### User Interface
- **Main Window**: The calculator features a clean and organized main window, displaying buttons for digits, operations, and a display area.
- **Display Area**: A text entry or label at the top shows the current input and results, allowing users to see their calculations in real time.

### Functional Buttons
- **Digit Buttons (0-9)**: Buttons for each digit, allowing users to input numbers easily.
- **Operation Buttons**: Buttons for basic arithmetic operations such as Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
- **Equal Button (=)**: When clicked, this button computes the result of the current expression displayed.
- **Clear Button (C)**: A button that clears the current input or resets the calculator.

### User Interaction
- Users can click buttons to input numbers and select operations. The calculator updates the display area dynamically as users enter their calculations.
- Pressing the equal button evaluates the expression, and the result is shown in the display area.

### Potential Enhancements
While this simple calculator performs basic functions, it can be expanded with additional features such as:
- **Advanced Operations**: Including functions for square roots, exponents, and percentages.
- **History Log**: A feature that keeps track of past calculations.
- **Keyboard Support**: Enabling the use of keyboard input for digits and operations.

This simple GUI calculator is an excellent project for beginners, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts while providing a practical tool for everyday calculations.
